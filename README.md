# Mobile-Linux-Command-GUI
Provides a Linux GUI for command line that automates a lot of linux commands. Great for phone management of Linux servers. Only thing you have to modify would be the $srv variable if service does not reside in /sbin/service. You can also modify the command list to any commands you would like to use.
